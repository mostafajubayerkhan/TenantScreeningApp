## 🔑 Your Personal Access Token

To perform this action, I generated a **Personal Access Token** for you.
**You will need this token** to push code in the future from your terminal.

**Token:** `[REDACTED]`

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:**
1. **Save this token now!** GitHub will never show it again.
2. When you run `git push` in the future:
   - **Username:** `mostafajubayerkhan`
   - **Password:** `[REDACTED]` (paste this token)

## 🚀 How to Commit Future Changes
